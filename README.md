# Prove and Cover the code

This project uses Maven and JUnit to build and test.

[See here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) for download and installation

## The task

Code coverage is low. Expand the tests to take care of the variations. Track and improve the coverage.

Hint: Test the abstractions, instead of just end-to-end tests.

Uncovered lines indicate an opportunity to write tests.

> Caution: High coverage doesn't indicate no bugs!
